# shared jade templates

This is a basic nodejs/expressjs project for that allows the use of shared jade templates by browser/client and node backend.

You can find an extensive description on [my website](http://lundner.com/2013/03/gemeinsame-jade-templates-fur-client-und-express-node-server/) (german).

### Getting started

First you will need to install the dependencies (expressjs and jade) by 

	npm install

When all packages are installed into the node_modules folder you can simply start the app with
	
	npm start
	
You should be able to access the demo-side on [127.0.0.1:3000](http://127.0.0.1:3000)
